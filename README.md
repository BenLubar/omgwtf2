To compile this, you'll need [Go](http://golang.org/doc/install). Here is a list of commands you might find useful:

`go get -u -d github.com/BenLubar/omgwtf2` download and/or update this code to your $GOPATH

`cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/BenLubar/omgwtf2` move to this folder

`go test` run all the test cases

`go build` build a native copy of the program

`GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build` build a win64 copy of the program, from an operating system that may or may not be win64, assuming you have the right tools compiled. [Here's a guide.](https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/WindowsCrossCompiling)
